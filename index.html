   <p>❖	Now-a-days , In this modern era people are forgetting many things due to their fast moving life. One such thing is forgetting to turn off the fan.Due to this current bill increases rapidly. To avoid this I have an idea of controlling the fan automatically using passive infrared sensors</p>
   <P>❖	These sensors detects the presence of humans by sensing the infrared radiations emitted from the body.</P> 
   <P>❖	With this device if we forget to turn off the fan also , it gets turned off automatically due to the absence of you</P>
   <h1>COMPONENTS USED:</h1>
   <P>❖	PIR SENSOR MODULE: These sensors detects the presence of human beings by sensing the infrared radiations emitted.</P>
   <P>❖	MICROCONTROLLER: A microcontroller process the input signal and performs calculations.</P>
   <P>❖	FAN MOTOR:To provide airflow.</P>
   <P>❖	CONTROL CIRCUIT:It consists of resistors,capacitors and a relay for switching on the motor.</P>
   <P>❖	LEDs:It emits infrared light which detects the IR signals and sends information to the Microcontroller.</P>
   <P>❖	REMOTE CONTROLLER:Used to control the speed of the light.</P>
   <h1>ADVANTAGES:</h1>
   <P>❖	We need not to turn on or off the fan manually.</P>
   <P>❖	Less expensive than the other sensors(eg:Camera sensor,....etc..).</P>
   <P>❖	Reduces power consumption.</P>
   <P>❖	Speed of the fan is controlled.</P>
   <h1>DISADVANTAGES:</h1>
   <P>❖	Range of the sensor is less when compared to other sensors.</P>
   <P>❖	Rotation of the fan is not controlled.</P>
